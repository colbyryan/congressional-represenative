          <p>
            Hagerty is the junior senator from Tennessee and is a Republican. He
            has served since Jan 3, 2021. Hagerty is next up for reelection in
            2026 and serves until Jan 3, 2027.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hagerty is among the Republican legislators whose attempt to
            disenfranchise Democratic states in the 2020 presidential election
            was a part of the months-long attempted coup that included the
            January 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol. In the days leading up
            to January 6, Hagerty had announced his intent to object on that day
            to the inclusion of some states in the count of electors that
            determines the next president, which would have disenfranchised
            millions of voters based on lies, conspiracy theories, and
            preposterous legal theories all falsely claiming various sorts of
            mass fraud that did not occur. The announcement amplified the
            message that inspired the attack on the Capitol. He ultimately did
            not vote to exclude any states from the Electoral College, however.
